The formation of suspensions of swimming bacteria self-aggregate in regions where the conditions are more favorable, for instance there is more oxygen. These high concentration regions propagate along the channel. This phenomena was first reported by Adler [1]. **Chemotaxis** is widely known to be responsible for the formation of these **travelling pulses** in capillary assays (or micro-channels).
